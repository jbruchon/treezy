Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
treezy is a "Swiss army knife" program for working with directory and
file trees. This is still a work in progress.

For now, treezy simply outputs machine-readable per-entry information,
tallies up the number of files, directories, and symbolic links under a
directory tree, and outputs those totals.

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Usage: treezy
```

In its current state, the software scans the current working directory
and its subtrees. There are no options.
